Basic takeaway is that, in spite of what the recruiter says, FEE interviews are different material than SDE interviews. This caught me off guard as I had studied algos, data structures, etc. Recruiter said "all engineers at Amazon are interviewed on the same material". Not really the case in my experience.... Hope this helps others.

Task:

- Build a small application & widget from scratch using HTML, CSS & vanilla JavaScript.
- Widget is a star rating component utilizing five stars.
- Stars should be grey and change to gold when the user selects one or hovers over it.
- All stars rated lower than the selected or hovered star should also change when selected/hovered.
- Stars should be displayed horizontally.
- Star did not need to be (visually) a star... could just be an element. I made mine a circle.
- This was for the AWS team.
